 *********************************************************************************************************************/
/* Module specific MISRA deviations:

  MD_VSECPRIM_STPAR:
    Reason:     Artificially restricting the number of parameters to a function would lead to less readable code.
                The function parameters are chosen in accordance with specifications and are complemented by
                other necessary parameters, such as length indications for buffers. 
    Risk:       Usage of function is not easily comprehensible. 
    Prevention: Code review. 

  MD_VSECPRIM_8.7:
    Reason:     Following this MISRA rule would lead to unreadable code, as the constant fields are huge.
                Vector style guide prevents usage of static variables/constant objects in function scope.
    Risk:       None
    Prevention: Not necessary

  MD_VSECPRIM_5.6:
    Reason:     Naming of the buffer and struct members are similar to provided parameters to make the code more
                readable.
    Risk:       One could read wrong and adapt the code falsely.
    Prevention: Covered by code review and tests.

  MD_VSECPRIM_11.4:
    Reason:     Casting between different pointer is necessary due to the nature of this library.
    Risk:       None - the basic types remain the same.
    Prevention: Covered by code review and tests.

  MD_VSECPRIM_13.1:
    Reason:     An assignment operator is being used in a boolean expression this decreases the
                readability of the code.
    Risk:       Code could be mistaken.
    Prevention: Additional comment is stated.

  MD_VSECPRIM_21.1:
    Reason:     There could be no wraparound because of the previous check.
    Risk:       None
    Prevention: N/A

  MD_VSECPRIM_16.7:
    Reason:     Pointer can only be const when method is empty and only Dummy statements are used.
    Risk:       None
    Prevention: Covered by code review.

  MD_VSECPRIM_14.6:
    Reason:     Two break statements are implemented to provide simple yet efficient code.
    Risk:       None
    Prevention: N/A

  MD_VSECPRIM_19.1:
    Reason:     The included file contains wrapper functions that can be used in different contexts. Before including
                it, it is necessary to define the data type the wrappers shall be defined for.
    Risk:       None
    Prevention: N/A

  MD_VSECPRIM_WATCHDOG:
    Reason:     Calling the watchdog trigger function depends basically on two factors:
                  - If the watchdog trigger function is a valid pointer
                  - Watchdog trigger level
    Risk:       None
    Prevention: N/A

  MD_VSECPRIM_P2VOID_CAST: MISRA Dir 1.1
    Reason:     The implicit conversion from a pointer to object type to a pointer to void is used calling functions
                that allow pointers to different object types as parameter.
    Risk:       There is an invalid conversion within the function from a pointer to void to a pointer to object type
                and thus invalid data are read.
    Prevention: Code inspection.

  MD_VSECPRIM_11.4_P2UINT8_CAST: MISRA Rule 11.4
    Reason:     The conversion from a pointer to void to a pointer to object type is used to access the object's memory byte-wisely.
                The size of the object's memory is known.
    Risk:       None
    Prevention: N/A

  MD_VSECPRIM_REDUNDANT_OP:
    Reason:     The redundant operation is a side effect of a better readability of the code.
    Risk:       None
    Prevention: N/A

  MD_VSECPRIM_CONFIGURATION_DEPENDENT_REDUNDANT_OP:
    Reason:     The redundant operation is a side effect of the configurability of the code and required to avoid
                compile errors in certain configurations.
    Risk:       None
    Prevention: N/A

  MD_VSECPRIM_ASSIGNMENT_RESULT_IN_OP: Misra Rule 13.4
    Reason:     The result of an assignment is being used in an arithmetic operation or another assigning operation in
                order to keep the processing flow of the algorithm's complex arithmetic operations as they are 
                described in the algorithm's specification.
    Risk:       None
    Prevention: N/A

  MD_VSECPRIM_USE_OF_BASIC_TYPES: Misra Dir 4.6
    Reason:     Only non safe files are affected.
    Risk:       None
    Prevention: Review.

  MD_VSECPRIM_CONST_BOOL_OPERAND: Misra Rule 14.3
    Reason:     Boolean operand might be constant in definition depend on configuration.
    Risk:       None
    Prevention: N/A

  MD_VSECPRIM_REDUNDANT_ASSIGNMENT: Misra Rule 2.2
    Reason:     Redundant assignment in last cycle of for loop.
    Risk:       None
    Prevention: N/A

  MD_VSECPRIM_ALGORITHM_REQUIRED_ASSIGNMENT
    Reason:     Redundant assignment due to algorithm specification
    Risk:       None
    Prevention: N/A


  MD_VSECPRIM_2.2
    Reason:     Redundant assignment to avoid compiler warning of use of potentially uninitialized variable.
    Risk:       None
    Prevention: N/A

  MD_VSECPRIM_CONST_POINTER: Misra Rule 8.13
    Reason:     The function parameter is a pointer to a pointer. The object referenced by the inner pointer 
                (and therefore also by the pointer to the pointer) is modified or the outer pointer is passed to another function, 
                but this is not detected by QAC. Thus, the parameter can not be passed as pointer-to-const.
    Risk:       The use of a pointer referencing another pointer makes the code more complicated to understand.
    Prevention: Code review.

  MD_VSECPRIM_8.9
    Reason:     An array lies in static ROM, but is only accessed in one function.
    Risk:       Additional Rom usage.
    Prevention: N/A

  MD_VSECPRIM_QM_ONLY_METRIC
    Reason:     A function in the QM part of the component violates a metric threshold. The function is
                proven in use.
    Risk:       Code is difficult to comprehend
    Prevention: Code review.

  MD_VSECPRIM_QM_ONLY_UNUSED_FUNCTION
    Reason:     A function in the QM part of the component is not used in some configurations. This affects
                placeholder functions that are used when a certain algorithm is turned off. The function is
                proven in use.
    Risk:       None
    Prevention: N/A

  MD_VSECPRIM_QM_ONLY_RETURN_PATHS
    Reason:     A function in the QM part of the component has more than one return path. The function is
                proven in use.
    Risk:       Code is difficult to comprehend
    Prevention: Code review.

  MD_VSECPRIM_QM_ONLY_REDUNDANT_ASSIGNMENT_OR_OPERATION
    Reason:     A redundant assignment or operation is made in the QM part of the component. The function is
                proven in use.
    Risk:       None
    Prevention: N/A

  MD_VSECPRIM_QM_ONLY_CASTING_POINTER_TYPE
    Reason:     A pointer is cast to a pointer referencing an object of different type in the QM part 
                of the component. The function is proven in use.
    Risk:       None
    Prevention: N/A

  MD_VSECPRIM_QM_ONLY_POINTER_ARITHMETIC
    Reason:     There is an arithmetic operation on a pointer in the QM part of the component. The function is
                proven in use.
    Risk:       Code is difficult to comprehend.
    Prevention: N/A

  MD_VSECPRIM_QM_ONLY_VARIABLE_IN_LOOP
    Reason:     In a for-loop, two variables instead of one are compared to a stopping criterion and are incremented
                in the QM part of the component. The function is proven in use.
    Risk:       Code is difficult to comprehend.
    Prevention: N/A

  MD_VSECPRIM_QM_ONLY_SHORT_DECREMENT_INCREMENT_OPERATION
    Reason:     A decrement or increment operation is used in combination with another operation in the QM part of the component.
                The function is proven in use.
    Risk:       Code is difficult to comprehend.
    Prevention: N/A

  MD_VSECPRIM_QM_ONLY_POINTER_CAST_TO_LARGER_TYPE
    Reason:     A pointer is cast to a type with a stricter alignment requirement in the QM part of the component.
                The function is proven in use.
    Risk:       None.
    Prevention: N/A

  MD_VSECPRIM_WRAPAROUND
    Reason:     There is a wraparound in an unsigned arithmetic operation. This is intended due to the specification of the algorithm.
    Risk:       None
    Prevention: Code review.

    \DESCRIPTION According to FETA, a loop may not terminate in function

                In this function, the x-coordinate of a point, x, on the elliptic curve is to be
                reduced by n, the fixed group order. It holds that n < x < p, where p is the fixed curve prime.
                The function subtracts n from x as long as the result is still larger than or equal to n.
    \COUNTERMEASURE \N In each iteration of the while loop, x is reduced by the positive value n, thus
                    eventually, x will be less than n.
                    At most (p-n)/n subtractions and thus iterations of the while loop are necessary,
                    since x < p and it holds that p - ((p-n)/n)*n = n. p and n are compared to configured
                    sizes before actECReduceXModN() is called (e.g. in actECInit).

  \ID FETA_VSECPRIM_ECDSA_SIGNATURE_GENERATION
    \DESCRIPTION According to FETA, a loop may not terminate in function
                - actECDSAsp().
                This function computes a signature according to the ECDSA specification. The signature
                consists of two components, r and s. If one of the two components is 0, the
                computation shall start over. This is realized in a while-loop.
    \COUNTERMEASURE \N The while-loop is endless by intention, in order to comply with the ECDSA specification.
                    This is documented in the CDD and in the TechRef. There, the ECDSA specification is
                    referenced, too.

  \ID FETA_VSECPRIM_ADD_UNTIL_REMAINDER_ZERO
    \DESCRIPTION According to FETA, a loop may not terminate in function
                - actECPMultG().
                This loop increments a variable i until the termination condition i mod x = 0 is reached.
    \COUNTERMEASURE \N i and x are of the same type. Thus, at most x iterations of the loop are required
                    before i mod x = 0 is reached.
                    Note: The loop could be replaced by a for-loop with x as upper bound, which would not
                    require a FETA justification. However, this would result in a condition 'iterator < x',
                    which is not testable with standard curves. If vSecPrim is used in combination with LibCv,
                    x = 2 or x = 3.

  \ID FETA_VSECPRIM_EDDSA_BARRETT_REDUCTION
    \DESCRIPTION According to FETA, a loop may not terminate in function
                - act25519_reduce().
                In this function, n is to be subtracted from an estimate of c = a mod n repeatedly,
                where a is a runtime parameter and n is a fixed curve parameter (prime p or order q).
                This is a step of the so-called Barrett reduction method.
    \COUNTERMEASURE \N In each iteration of the while loop, a is reduced by the positive value n, thus
                    eventually, a will be less than n.
                    Since all input values a for this function fulfil a < n^2, which is ensured by review,
                    one subtraction is sufficient to reach a < n. However, in order to account for input
                    values up to n, more subtractions are provided.

  \ID FETA_VSECPRIM_DEFAULT_FOR_LOOP
    \DESCRIPTION According to FETA, an increasing loop may not terminate.
    \COUNTERMEASURE \N [CM_VSECPRIM_FOR_LOOP_WITH_FIXED_BOUND]

  \ID FETA_VSECPRIM_WHILE_LOOP
    \DESCRIPTION According to FETA, a while loop may not terminate.
    \COUNTERMEASURE \N The while loop's termination condition can be reached without the occurrence of over-
                    or underflows. In each iteration, the iterator is strictly monotonically increased or decreased,
                    respectively. Thus, the maximal number of iterations of the loop is determined by the size
                    of the type of the iterator.
                    Potentially in addition to that, break statement are used to terminate the loop sooner.

  \ID FETA_VSECPRIM_ACTCMACAES_WHILE_LOOP
    \DESCRIPTION According to FETA, a while loop may not terminate in function
                - actCMACAESProcess().
    \COUNTERMEASURE \N This loop has two termination conditions which have to be met both:
                       (rest > 0u) || (processLastBlock == TRUE). This function is called in two use cases:
                       1) During an CMAC update: In this use case, processLastBlock is always set to FALSE. rest is
                          reduced until it reaches the value 0.
                       2) During the finish step: In this use case, processLastBlock is set to TRUE and will be set
                          to FALSE during the last iteration. This step uses the subkey as input which is specified
                          to have a size of 16 bytes. Therefore, the value of rest is set to 16 before the loop and
                          is decreased to 0 during the iterations.
                       In both cases, rest can never underflow as the value of rest itself is the maximum value which
                       is subtracted.

  \ID FETA_VSECPRIM_ACTKECCACKF_PERMUTATION_WHILE_LOOP
    \DESCRIPTION According to FETA, a while loop may not terminate in function
                - KECCACKf().
    \COUNTERMEASURE \N The while loop traverses over the array pi_lane[] in 24 iterations. By passing through the array,
                       it is ensured that the termination condition of the loop is met and that the variable src has the
                       value 1 after the last pass. For the order of the iterations, see the definition of pi_lane[] in
                       the file actKECCACKf-64.h.

  \ID FETA_VSECPRIM_ACTKECCACKF_ABSORB_SQUEEZE_WHILE_LOOP
    \DESCRIPTION According to FETA, a while loop may not terminate in functions
                - actKECCAKcAbsorb() and
                - actKECCAKcSqueeze().
    \COUNTERMEASURE \N The loop contains three branches. In each branch, the value of the counting variable len/size is
                       decreased until the terminating condition of the loop is reached. The counting variable can never
                       underflow as each branch implements an underflow check and the maximum value which is subtracted
                       from len/size is the value of len/size itself.
